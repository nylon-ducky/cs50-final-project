# My 50x Maze
#### Video Demo:  <URL https://youtu.be/cyW9kdSaD7g>
#### Description:
This is a JavaScript maze generator using p5js. It's a recursive backtracker and keeps track of the solution as it creates the maze. Once a solution is reached, It's randomized, moving to cells at random and knocking down walls.

As with any JS project, I have an index.html file, a CSS file, which has so little in it that I could have just used some style tags, and of course, the main.js file.

This is where the magic happens!
